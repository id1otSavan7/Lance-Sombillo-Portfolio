                            Greetings!<br><br>
                            I am <strong>Lance Andrei C. Sombillo</strong>, a recent graduate under the 
                            degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Enginerring in Holy Cross College of
                            Sta Ana, Pampanga, Philippines, truly a proud crucian.
                            <br><br>
                            I am quite flexible in both Hardware and Software field. Became a Tech Entusiast 
                            because one of my hobby is focused on building simple technologies that can be 
                            helpful to day-to-day use or for enterntainment purposes. I have experienced 
                            becoming a Hardware Developer, and it was a true passion. On the other hand, I
                            am proud programmer as well, both capable on Web Development and Mobile App 
                            Development.

                            The Holy Cross College, is known as a school with a heart- is located in 
                            Sta. Lucia, Sta. Ana, Pampanga, Philippines, and is the reason I graduated
                            without experiencing financial problems. I am loyal to where I grow up on, 
                            spending part of my decade to this school, enjoying watching it grow every 
                            year. The teachers, instructors, professors/ substitute are memorable,
                            leaving a stories and lessons that will last of a life time. It was here I 
                            started as nothing, and it was here I finished becoming something.
